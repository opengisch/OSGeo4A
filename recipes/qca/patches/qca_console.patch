-   \class Console qca_support.h QtCrypto
-
-   %QCA %Console system
-
-   %QCA provides an API for asynchronous, event-based access to
-   the console and stdin/stdout, as these facilities are
-   otherwise not portable.  The primary use of this system within
-   %QCA is for passphrase prompting in command-line applications,
-   using the tty console type.
-
-   How it works: Create a %Console object for the type of console
-   desired, and then use ConsoleReference to act on the console.
-   Only one ConsoleReference may operate on a %Console at a time.
-
-   A %Console object takes over either the physical console (Console::Tty
-   type) or stdin/stdout (Console::Stdio type).  Only one of each type
-   may be created at a time.
-
-   Whenever code is written that needs a tty or stdio object, the
-   code should first call one of the static methods (ttyInstance()
-   or stdioInstance()) to see if a console object for the desired
-   type exists already.  If the object exists, use it.  If it does
-   not exist, the rule is that the relevant code should create the
-   object, use the object, and then destroy the object when the
-   operation is completed.
-
-   By following the above rule, you can write code that utilizes
-   a console without the application having to create some master
-   console object for you.  Of course, if the application has
-   created a console then it will be used.
-
-   The reason why there is a master console object is that it
-   is not guaranteed that all I/O will survive creation and
-   destruction of a console object.  If you are using the Stdio
-   Type, then you probably want a long-lived console object.  It
-   is possible to capture unprocessed I/O by calling
-   bytesLeftToRead or bytesLeftToWrite.  However, it is not
-   expected that general console-needing code will call these
-   functions when utilizing a temporary console.  Thus, an
-   application developer would need to create his own console
-   object, invoke the console-needing code, and then do his own
-   extraction of the unprocessed I/O if necessary.  Another reason
-   to extract unprocessed I/O is if you need to switch from
-   %Console back to standard functions (e.g. fgets() ).
